Top 10 Games in 2022
</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>
Elden Ring
</b>
<p>
<br>
(Xbox One/Series S/Series X, PlayStation 4/5, PC) The long-awaited fantasy
<br>
epic from Dark Souls' creators FromSoftware, with narrative input from
<br>
George RR Martin. It combines a huge, detailed open world, inhabited by
<br>
everything from dragons and wolves to trolls and patrolling soldiers, with
<br>
the developer's signature heart-in-mouth, swords-and-sorcery combat. An
<br>
intriguing world to discover alone, or with other players.
</p>
<br>
<b>
Stray
</b>
<p>
<br>
(PlayStation 4/5, PC) A game about being a cat in a cyberpunk city, using your
<br>
feline agility and talent for blending into the background to spy on the robots
<br>
who live there, and fit into the hidden urban spaces that aren't ordinarily
<br>
seen. In development for years, this mysterious game has only become more
<br>
intriguing with each delay.
</p>
<br>
<b>
Ghostwire:Tokyo
</b>
<p>
<br>
(PlayStation 5, PC) Imagine that something mysterious has happened in
<br>
Japan's capital, leaving it almost entirely devoid of people and populated
<br>
instead by ghosts. And then you have to fight the ghosts, with your bare
<br>
hands. That's Ghostwire: Tokyo, a game whose visual effects alone make it
<br>
worthy of notice.
</p>
<br>
<b>
God of War Ragnarok
</b>
<p>
<br>
(PlayStation 4/5) Put-upon former Greek God-botherer Kratos, now a grumpy
<br>
widower, continues his journey through Norse mythology with his
<br>
adolescent son in this visually stunning and viscerally violent action game.
<br>
Having made some troubling discoveries and angered a whole bunch of
<br>
Norse gods in their previous adventure, they must tread carefully through
<br>
these fabled realms.
</p>
<br>
<b>
Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals
</b>
<p>
<br>
(PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4/5) The star feature of 2016's spooky,
<br>
character-driven thriller Oxenfree was its conversation. Its characters carry
<br>
on natural-feeling dialogue throughout, as you investigate the goings-on at a
<br>
mysterious island where local teens have long gathered to party. Not much is 
<br>
known about this sequel, but the developer's talent for atmosphere makes it 
<br>
one to watch.
</p>
<br>
<b>
Splatoon 3
</b>
<p>
<br>
(Nintendo Switch) This wacky series of paint-splattering kid-friendly
<br>
shooters is the poster child of the new school of Nintendo game design,
<br>
where every idea gets a fair shot. Frenetic, colourful and unassailably stylish,
<br>
play in a team vying to cover funky urban maps in colourful ink. The squid
<br>
game that everybody should be talking about.
</p>
<br>
<b>
Horizon Forbidden West
</b>
<p>
<br>
(PlayStation 4/5) Flame-haired robot dinosaur slayer Aloy returns in this
<br>
PlayStation 5 flagship game, which has us exploring the far reaches of a
<br>
North American continent that has long since been returned to nature – apart
<br>
from all the killer machines. Expect to be stunned by how realistic this world
<br>
looks, and touched by the stories to be found within it.
</p>
<br>
<b>
Gran Turismo 7
</b>
<p>
<br>
(PlayStation 4/5) The ultimate in realistic racing games, made by the world's
<br>
most obsessive motor sports enthusiasts at Polyphony Digital in Japan. Drive
<br>
around fastidiously detailed tracks in all kinds of changing weather, in
<br>
pristine, beautiful cars that would be entirely out of reach in real life. 
<br>
Petrolheads are likely to spend as much time gawping at the vehicles as
<br>
driving them.
</p>
<br>
<b>
Starfield
</b>
<p>
<br>
(Xbox Series X/S, PC) A sci-fi role-playing epic from Bethesda, makers of the
<br>
famously absorbing Elder Scrolls series of fantasy games. Create a space
<br>
explorer in your own image, and spend hundreds of hours jetting about
<br>
nearby star systems. We've not had much in the way of landmark sci-fi
<br>
games since the Mass Effect series, so hopes are high for this.
</p>
<br>
<b>
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2
</b>
<p>
<br>
(Nintendo Switch) It still doesn't have an official title, but Nintendo's sequel
<br>
to its most ambitious Zelda game is looming on the horizon. If it offers
<br>
anything like the scope and variety of its predecessor, where every shrine,
<br>
forest or distant encampment of monsters promised something interesting to
<br>
discover, it will be a game that you could spend the whole year playing.
